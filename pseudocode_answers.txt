Short Answer

1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?
	
	A: Pseudocode is typically used to brainstorm and develop algorithms without having to write out actual code in a specific coding language. It is easy for people to read and understand.

2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

	A: Nothing. There is no real code involved, it is written in English describing the processes a programmer will follow when they write the actual code.



Programming Assignment

Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

INPUT first number
INPUT second number
IF first number is greater than or equal to second number
	PRINT first number
ELSE
	PRINT second number


2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

SET number to 0
WHILE the number is less than 100
	ADD 1 to number
	PRINT number
ENDWHILE


3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

SET variable to ARRAY
INPUT a name
IF name is found in ARRAY
	PRINT name and location in array
ELSE
	PRINT 'Not Found' 
END
4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.


var phoneBook = ['John Smith', 'Steve Smith', 'Zack Smith']

function nameFinder(phoneBook, name){
  var location=''
  
  for (var i = 0; i < phoneBook.length; i++) {
      if (name == phoneBook[i]) {
        location = (name + ' at ' + i)
      }
  }
  if (location === '') {
    return 'Not found'
  } else {
    return location
  }    
}
